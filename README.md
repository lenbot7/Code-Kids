## Introduction

The Code Kids course is designed to introduce students to programming concepts and techniques using Python. The course includes example scripts for various topics, such as functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), APIs, file encryption, and a Tic Tac Toe game.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for different days and topics:

- `Python/Day 1`: Functions and scope
- `Python/Day 2`: OOP introduction and examples
- `Python/Day 4`: APIs and web requests
- `Python/Day 5`: File read/write and encryption
- `Python/Tic Tac Toe`: Tic Tac Toe game project

## Scripts Overview

### Day 1: Functions and Scope

- `functions-day-1.py`: This script covers basic functions, scope, and various examples.

### Day 2: OOP Introduction and Examples

- `day-2.py`: This script includes a simple countdown and a "Guess My Number" game.
- `oop.py`: This script demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts with classes for `Pet`, `Address`, and `Person`.

### Day 4: APIs and Web Requests

- `apis-day-4.py`: This script introduces APIs and web requests, including a random joke generator and a simple calculator.

### Day 5: File Read/Write and Encryption

- `files-day-5.py`: This script covers file read/write operations and basic file encryption/decryption.

### Tic Tac Toe Game Project

- `tictactoe.py`: This script implements a Tic Tac Toe game with a `Board` class and a `Player` class.

## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the Python file using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example, to run the `functions-day-1.py` script, navigate to the `Python/Day 1` directory and execute:

```bash
python functions-day-1.py
```

## Dependencies

Some scripts may require additional dependencies. To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to check the script for any specific dependencies and install them accordingly.
